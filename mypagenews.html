</p> <b> <i>Why I chose Saint Mary's: </p> </b> </i>
<p>I chose to come to Saint Mary's for a few reasons. First, it was close to home. I am very close with my family and felt that it was important for me to stay close to home so I can go home whenever I wanted. Second, my cousin goes here and is a few years older than me, so I knew that there would be a familiar face around campus and I would not be alone. Third and finally, I chose Saint Mary's because it was a small school. I have only gone to small private schools and have done very well in that type of environment, so I felt that it would be too overwhelming to go to a bigger school. At Saint Mary's, I can form relationships with my teachers and peers easily which definitely helps my learning. I am glad I chose this school. I have made close bonds and relationships with people here which has made my college experience that much more enjoyable.</p>

<p> <b>My Favorite Spot On Campus Currently: </p> </b>
<p> One of the reasons why I like Saint Mary's is because the campus is super pretty! My favorite spot on campus would have to be my job at campus housing because it is on the ground floor of Augustine and I get to see so many of my friends running to and from class and they always will stop by to say hello to me! </p>
